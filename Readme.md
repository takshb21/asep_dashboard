## 📖 Background

The ASEP Data Dashboard was developed in support of the [UT System's ElevateTXed initiative](https://elevatetxed.utsystem.edu/). It was envisioned and collaboratively designed by the I2I Data Workgroup (members below). The primary goal of this project is to enhance the capacity of educator preparation programs (EPPs) to use data for continuous improvement, informed decision-making, and alignment with state accountability metrics.

This software allows users to securely upload raw data files from multiple TEA sources — including I2I, ECOS, ResultsAnalyzer, and others — and automatically convert those files into EPP-specific dashboards in alignment with the [24-25 Texas Accountability System for Educator Preparation Manual](https://tea.texas.gov/educators/preparation-and-continuing-education/consumer-information-about-educator-preparation-programs/24-25-asep-manual.pdf). The intent of this dashboard is to aggregate these disparate data sources into a unified environment, directly aligned with ASEP standards, using real-time, student-level data. Our hope is that this tool will enable EPPs to monitor progress on accountability benchmarks and serve as an early warning system to identify areas of strength and risk.

## 📖 Overview

This dashboard automates the process of calculating ASEP compliance metrics for an Educator Preparation Program (EPP). Instead of manually combining reports from **I2I**, **ECOS**, and **ResultsAnalyzer**, users upload the raw exports directly, and the app:

1. Auto-detects and renames uploaded files based on their structure.
2. Merges and cleans the data per chapter/indicator.
3. Calculates each ASEP indicator (1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 5).
4. Produces a weighted, demographic-broken-down **ASEP Index Score** with a visual gauge.

## 🧭 How to Use the App

1. **Go to Data Management** — Upload the required Excel/CSV files for the chapters you need.
2. **Rename before uploading if prompted** — Some files look identical when exported and must be renamed manually first.
3. **Confirm the files were recognized** — The page shows an arrow (➡️) mapping your original file name to the renamed name the app uses internally.
4. **Go to Dashboard** — Each Chapter tab auto-populates once its required datasets are uploaded. A tab showing a warning means a file is still missing.
5. **Check Chapter 8** — View the combined, weighted ASEP Index Score with a color-coded gauge (🟢 ≥85%, 🟡 80–85%, 🔴 <80%).
6. **Use Feedback** — Report issues or request changes anytime through the built-in form.

## 🔒 Data Security

When running the desktop version of this application, data files will never leave your hard drive. The software is designed to run entirely locally so that private student information never leaves the environment from which it was originally downloaded. The software neither operates nor stores data in any environment other than where you originally downloaded the files.

If you are unable to run the desktop version, we have developed a [Streamlit](https://asepdashboard-kqt5fwct9wzlnxgqnf2qsb.streamlit.app/) site that allows users to access the tool from a browser. Streamlit is [SOC 2 Type 1 compliant](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/streamlit-cloud-is-now-soc-2-type-1-compliant/20850), and more information on their security practices is available [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/trust-and-security).
